## Project Structure
This project uses [TanStack Router File-Based Routing.](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/file-based-routing)

Inside the 'routes' folder we can find:
- __root.tsx: Root layout file for the application.
- podcast/: Folder that contains the podcast (/podcast/$podcastId) and episode (/podcast/$podcastId/episode/$episodeId) pages.
- routeTree.gen.ts: Automatically generated routing tree with vite's plugin (currently disabled because it's breaking the $episodeId page).

## Data Loading
We make use of [TanStack Router data loading](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading) to take advantage of it's convenient loading/error handling, as well as the integrated caching.

It's important to keep in mind that for the podcast details, in the case of the description and high-resolution cover image, they need to be obtained from a request to the **feedUrl**, which is included in the data from the first request to the podcast details inside **fetchPodcastDetails**.

The request for the description and image can get really slow, mainly because of having to make the request through [allorigins.win](https://allorigins.win/) and parsing an XML. We use TanStack Query to make sure we only need to make that request once.
